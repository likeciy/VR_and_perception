Title:
Exploring Immersive Realities: VR and Perception
Description:
In this project, we will explore how virtual reality (VR) technology interacts with human perception. 
We will restore a specific historical scene and create an incredible immersive experience for users. 
By combining advanced VR technology and perception research, our project aims to unlock the potential of virtual reality and make it closer to natural experiences. 
We will explore how perception channels such as vision, hearing, and touch convey information in virtual environments and simulate sensory experiences in the real world. 
This project will cover the application of virtual reality in fields such as education and entertainment. 
Our goal is to promote the forefront of virtual reality technology and open up new possibilities for future virtual experiences.
