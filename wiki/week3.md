## 1.Read some articals

- [VR education and rehabilitation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/257874.257886)

## 2.Have some basic idea of my project
### Deelop a VR games about restore a historical scene.
Since history is something that has already happened in the past, and we who live in the present will never truly experience it. 
In China, there is a term called 'empathize'. So perhaps if we can reconstruct past history, we will have a deeper understanding of the situation at that time, 
which will provide essential help for students to learn history or historical researchers to summarize a certain historical stage.

### Make VR more humanized
Conforming to human body design.
Can it be fully worn without any light entering.
Does it support adjustment of pupil distance and object distance or wearing glasses for use.
Is the weight of the equipment appropriate, the fabric breathable, and whether there is any discomfort when wearing it.

Better simulation of gait movements.
When we move in VR games, we rely more on the operation of the controller, which sometimes reduces our gaming experience due to the delayed effect. 
By equipped with a VR treadmill, we can achieve equal distance movement and have a strong immersive feeling.
